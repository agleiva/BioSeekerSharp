## Requirements:

.NET 7.0

 - [Install on Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-2304#install-the-sdk) (install the SDK only, the Runtime is already included)

 - [Install on Mac](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) (see SDK option in the left side of the page)

## Instructions

With .NET 7.0 SDK installed, clone this repository, open a terminal and go to the `src` folder, then run
