# Comparison between original project and this port

The main idea of this port is to demonstrate that C#/.NET is a more capable, more suitable technological base than python to write data analysis projects, from a technical and software engineering standpoint.

In the coming days, I will write a detailed comparison of both projects, highlighting the following aspects:

 - LOC count
 - Code readability
 - General mindset of the code
 - Execution performance (benchmarks)
 - Environment and project setup experience
 - Debugging experience
 - Dependencies (libraries, etc)
 - Final result (CSV file)
 - Program packaging and distribution
